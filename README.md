# 📊 Predicting Deutsche Bank’s Net Income  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project forecasts **Deutsche Bank’s Net Income** using a hybrid approach:  
✔ **Feature-Based Machine Learning Models** (XGBoost & Linear Regression)  
✔ **Time-Series Model** (ARIMA)  

By combining both techniques, we aim to improve predictive accuracy and gain financial insights.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔ Develop a **hybrid model** for Net Income forecasting.  
✔ Identify **key financial indicators** influencing Net Income.  
✔ Compare **XGBoost, Linear Regression & ARIMA** models.  
✔ Evaluate performance using **RMSE, MAE & R² Score**.  

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The dataset consists of **historical financial data** from 2015 onward, including:  
✔ **Revenue, Operating Income, Expenses**  
✔ **Interest Expense, Tax Expense**  
✔ **Net Income (Target Variable)**

## 📊 Results & Insights
✔ XGBoost: Strong performance with feature importance insights.  
✔ Linear Regression: Provides interpretability but less accurate.  
✔ ARIMA: Captures time-based trends but lacks feature consideration.  
✔ Conclusion: Hybrid approach balances accuracy & explainability.
